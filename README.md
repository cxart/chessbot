# chessbot

this is my attempt at creating a simple chess game + bot using JS! note it is playable but still a work in progress

# things i haven't added yet

- check / checkmate; you currently win by capturing the opponent's king (or winning on time)
- castling
- pawn promotion
- en passant
- any bot strategy

# notes on bot strategy

currently on each turn the bot just collects a list of all legal moves and picks one at random, but goes super fast

# other random notes

some credit to gpt for helping with bugs
i stole the piece pngs from chesscom hehe
